Classical pipeline: BTD => Build/Test/Deploy
CI => Build/Test
CD => Deploy

Local:                          
 Lint                 |              
---v---               |

Test IntÃ©gration         |

test env: (do above steps again)
---v---
Deploy into a new env  cp prod data
---V---
New tests (stress/performance tests) 

prod env: 
---v---
Deploy into env 
---V--- 
New tests (stress/performance tests) 

VM configuration => configuration manager => Ansible

Ansible:
- From your local machine
- Connects by SSH to a remote one
- Give orders to those machines
        
        SSH
Local ------> VM

Orchestration with Ansible is a bad idea because no state files
