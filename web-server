Many webservers are asynchron => they treat as many requests as possible 
and they respond when they can.

- A user send a method POST 
- Server asks to DB to create the object
- DB creates an object and send its id to server
- Server responds id of object to client (to help client tracking the object)

API REST: Urls are formated following those rules:
- /cards/
- /card/{id}
- no client information is stored between get requests

C: printf is a variadic function: iterates to all elements => 
type string ... => whatever number of str

PATCH = modifier (seulement quelques elements)
PUT = supprimer et ajouter (tous les elements)
