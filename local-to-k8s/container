Volume = bridge between a filesystem of a container and a local filesystem

Never containerize:
1) Statefull app
2) Not Scalable app
3) If I do not have the ressources to do it

example 1) Database => because a container can be destroyed 
example 2) Legacy App

example 3) 
Let's take a big company => A
A have paid for Kube to manage containers.
Kube is very expensive so the company want to contenerize all its app
The company have to paid to form people to contenerization, hire people to 
maintain Kube.
Some application are not designed for contenerization
=> It is not worth it to contenerize

People wants to contenerize DB.
Pb is DB is writing on the filesystem of the VM which is running the container.
People has invented a software to connect where the DB is writing to the cloud.
With this functionality, it is now possible to contenerize Db => But not very
smart.

Redis is a DB very powerful for cache functionnality.

People contenerize the software to monitore containers
But not very smart because if the monitore software has a pb.
No ones know if there's a pb.
